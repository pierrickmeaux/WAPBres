\section{Experimental results}
To further support our claims, we provide an open-source implementation of our
main results in SageMath \cite{sagemath} available at \texttt{https://www.github.com/wapbres/wapbres}.
We give a basis of code to test Theorems~\ref{thm:WalsCorr}, \ref{Th_K_V_matrices}
and \ref{thm:t_corrector_Vandemonde_matrix} for small spaces; especially
constructors for Krawtchouk and Vandermonde matrices of different orders as well
as an implementation of Theorem~\ref{thm:WalsCorr}.

We also verified that Conjecture~\ref{conj:wapb-corr} holds for all dimensions
$n$ up to $n = 62$. Our approach consists in exhausting all balanced vectors
$\vecy \in \{\pm1\}^{\w(n)}$ and computing $t$ as in Theorem~\ref{thm:t_corrector_Vandemonde_matrix}.
This has the advantage of involving smaller vectors and matrices to work with,
directly reducing the number of computations from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^{2^{\w(n)}})$.
Precisely there are $\binom{2^{\w(n)}}{2^{\w(n) - 1}}$ such vectors for which we
keep track of the the largest $t$-correction. We give a brief summary of the
performance of our method in Table~\ref{tab:execution_times}. All execution
times are in seconds and performed on a single core 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
i5-1345U 4.7 GHz.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Correction order of WAPB functions in $n \leq 62$ variables.}
    \label{tab:execution_times}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $\corr(f)$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
        \hline
        $\w(n)$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
        \hline
        time (s) & 0.02 & 0.03 & 0.06 & 0.21 & 8916.26\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We see that for values of $n$ such that $\w(n) = 5$, searching through $\approx2^{32}$
vectors takes around 2h30. Thus, we haven't been able to verify Conjecture~\ref{conj:wapb-corr}
for $n = 63$ and above since a hamming weight of 6 induces a search space of
$\approx 2^{64}$ vectors.
